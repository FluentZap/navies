* The Project gives you a computer desktop assistant to help with all your computer needs
* It is currently in development and many of the core features are not implemented yet


## Under the hood

* Windows GDI
* OpenGL C# framework OpenTK
* .Net socket programming for P2P TCP connections
* Imbedded .Net Libraries and dynamic loading to make a single file project
